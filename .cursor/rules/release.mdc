# Release & Versioning Checklist

PRE-FLIGHT CHECKS
-----------------
- Pull latest `main` and `dev`.
- Run full test/CI suite locally; abort on failure.
- Update CHANGELOG.md (new version + highlights).

VERSION BUMP
------------
- Grep repo (code, docs, CI, Docker, manifests) for old version; replace with new.
- Commit *only* these edits:  `chore: bump to vX.Y.Z`.

RELEASE WORKFLOW
----------------
1. Merge `dev` → `main`.
2. Tag `main` with annotated tag `vX.Y.Z`; push branch + tag.
3. Wait for CI on `main`; if green, publish release (use changelog for notes).

POST-RELEASE HOUSEKEEPING
-------------------------
1. Checkout `dev`, merge `main` into it.
2. Bump `dev` to next snapshot based on the release version number; add empty “Unreleased” section to changelog.
3. Push `dev`.

QUICK SANITY LIST
-----------------
- Docs / README version badges updated.
- Generated artifacts (e.g., lockfiles) committed.
- All tags and branches pushed to remote.
